This likeness of the "Klingon Empire Logo" was created based on, but
not digitally copied from, a production artwork that is most likely
copyrighted by Paramount Pictures or CBS Studios, but is used here under
Fair Use/Fair Dealing guidelines. The use of the likeness is considered
to be a fair use for the following reasons:

  (1) it is used here soley for a non-commercial purpose; and,
  (2) The work is considered to be "highly transformative"[1] as it 
      changes the original purpose from entertainment and aesthetics
      to one that is 32px square in size and provides indications of 
      warnings and errors in a text editor. In doing so, it "provides
      an entirely new use for the original work"[1].
